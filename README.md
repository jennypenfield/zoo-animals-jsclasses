<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg" alt="Standard - JavaScript Style Guide">

The purpose of this homework is to create a main class (Animal) and specific classes (Mammal and Reptile) that extend the parent class using JavaScript.
### The parent class 'Animal' includes the following:
* constructor
* name and date of birth  
* get method is included for the date of birth (it may only be retrieved, not changed).    
* method for determining age in years  
* toString() method that prints out the name and date of birth

### The 'Mammal' and 'Reptile' classes extend the 'Animal' class and inherit from the parent constructor. The 'Mammal' and 'Reptile' classes include the following:
* static method that returns the species  
* giveBirth() or layEggs() methods that create a new instance of the object
* two other methods specific to a species that print to console using a specific argument entered  
* toString() method that prints out the name and date of birth
